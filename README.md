# Graphics-Projects
Projects created in Processing for Computer Grahpics

## Description
This repository contains projects written in the Processing language for a computer graphics course. Processing is a language based on Java that runs in its own IDE and is used to create 2D or 3D graphics and animations. Here is a link to the [Processing](https://processing.org) website.

Though the projects were written in Processing 3.8, they have all been tested to run in Processing 4.0.

## Project Overview
Here is a descriptive list of all the projects contained in this directory, organized roughly by complexity

### 3D Projects
* **interactive_robot_arm**: basic 3D simulation of joint movement in Processing using a HashSet to keep track of key presses
* **vogel_spiral**: sunflower seeds arranged in 3D according to the vogel spiral with smooth color gradients
* **parametric_texture_mapping**: flat-shaded, texture-mapped 3D shell generated with a parametric equation
* **particle_system**: animated, 3D particle system using a GLSL POINT shader to draw "billboarded" shapes

### 2D Projects
* **piet_mondrian_generator**: nondeterministic art generator using rectangles and a given color palette
* **fractal_circles**: 2D model of a fractal series of circles
* **homicide_visualization**: visualization of a data file using a parallel coordinates plot
* **gradient_ellipse**: 2D outline of an ellipse shape with color gradients
